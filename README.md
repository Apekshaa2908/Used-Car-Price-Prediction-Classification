## Used Car Price Prediction & Classification

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling used car data to understand pricing patterns and build predictive models. The goal is to help estimate a car's resale value and categorize it into price segments based on various features such as brand, model, engine specs, usage, fuel type, and more. Using simple machine learning techniques—Linear Regression for price prediction and Logistic Regression for price classification—the project demonstrates how basic models can provide insights and aid decision-making in the used car market.

# Project Summary – Key Steps

Loaded and cleaned the used car dataset

Renamed inconsistent column names for clarity

Selected relevant features and target (Price)

Handled missing values in key columns

Encoded categorical variables using OneHotEncoding

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

Built a Linear Regression model to predict car prices

Evaluated model using RMSE and R² score

Created price categories (Low, Medium, High) using quantiles

Built a Logistic Regression model to classify price categories

Evaluated classification using confusion matrix and classification report

Visualized results for both models
